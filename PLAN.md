## Implementation Tasks

### Match Logic (`crates/match-logic`)
- [x] Core types (Move, StrategyBase, MatchResult)
- [x] All 9 base strategies
- [x] Match execution with history
- [x] Seeded PRNG (deterministic)
- [x] Pairing generation (deduplicated, circular method)
- [x] Fix Gradual strategy to match architecture spec

### Smart Contract (`programs/dilemma-arena`)

#### Account Structure Fixes
- [x] Add `operator` key to Config (admin ≠ operator)
- [x] Add `max_participants` to Config (default 5000)
- [x] Remove `stake_lock_hours` from Config (players can refund anytime)
- [x] Add `players: Vec<Pubkey>` to Tournament (for index assignment)
- [x] Add `payout_started_at: i64` to Tournament (for claim expiry)
- [x] Snapshot `stake`, `house_fee_bps`, `matches_per_player` to Tournament at creation
- [x] Rename `opponents_per_agent` to `matches_per_player` for consistency
- [x] Remove `lock_until` from Entry (no stake lock)

#### Instruction Fixes
- [x] `initialize_config`: Create Tournament #0 on init
- [x] `enter_tournament`: Index = `tournament.players.len()`, push to players vec
- [x] `claim_refund`: Allowed anytime during Registration (no lock), set players[index] = default
- [x] `close_registration`: Extend deadline if min not met (don't cancel); refund last if odd count
- [x] `run_matches`: Batch 5 matches per tx using remaining_accounts
- [x] `finalize_tournament`: Create next tournament with snapshotted config
- [x] `claim_payout`: Add 30-day expiry check (CLAIM_EXPIRY_SECONDS = 2,592,000)
- [x] `close_expired_entry`: New instruction for cleanup after 30-day expiry

#### Error Codes (per architecture)
- [x] 6000 InvalidState
- [x] 6001 RegistrationClosed
- [x] 6002 AlreadyEntered
- [x] 6003 NotWinner
- [x] 6004 AlreadyPaid
- [x] 6005 Unauthorized
- [x] 6006 InsufficientFunds
- [x] 6007 MatchesIncomplete
- [x] 6008 NoFeesToWithdraw
- [x] 6009 ClaimExpired
- [x] 6010 NotExpired
- [x] 6011 SlotHashUnavailable
- [x] 6012 TournamentFull
- [x] 6013 InvalidEntryAccount
- [x] 6014 InvalidMinParticipants

#### Validation
- [x] min_participants must be even and >= 2
- [x] Operator-only constraints on lifecycle instructions

#### Tests
- [x] Test infrastructure setup (TypeScript/Mocha)
- [x] Unit tests for each instruction (13 tests passing)
- [x] Integration tests
- [x] Localnet deployment test

#### Dynamic Account Sizing (Realloc) ✅

Tournament accounts now grow incrementally as players join.

**Contract changes:**
- [x] `initialize_config`: Create Tournament #0 with base size only (~121 bytes)
- [x] `enter_tournament`: Add `realloc` to grow account by 36 bytes per player
- [x] `enter_tournament`: Player pays rent delta (in addition to stake)
- [x] `finalize_tournament`: Create next tournament with base size only
- [x] Remove hardcoded `Tournament::space(100)` from account constraints
- [x] Add `Tournament::BASE_SPACE` constant and `BYTES_PER_PLAYER` for allocation

**Test changes:**
- [x] Existing tests pass (balance checks still valid — rent delta is small)
- [ ] Add test for max_participants limit with realloc (optional)
- [ ] Add test for many players (optional, verify at scale)

**Operator changes:**
- [x] Tournament deserialization handles variable-size vecs (already supported)

### Admin CLI (`cli/`)
- [x] Project structure (Rust, clap)
- [x] TOML config loading (`arena.toml`)
- [x] `arena init` — initialize config + Tournament #0
- [x] `arena config show` — display on-chain config
- [x] `arena config update` — update config parameters
- [x] `arena withdraw-fees` — withdraw house fees
- [x] `arena status` — current tournament state
- [x] `arena tournament <id>` — specific tournament details
- [x] `arena entries` — list entries for a tournament
- [x] `arena enter` — enter tournament with wallet/strategy
- [x] `arena refund` — claim refund
- [x] `arena claim` — claim payout
- [x] `arena balance` — check wallet balance
- [x] `arena airdrop` — devnet airdrop
- [x] `--dry-run` flag on write operations

### Operator Bot (`operator/`)
- [x] Project structure
- [x] State monitoring (fetch Config, Tournament, Entry)
- [x] Lifecycle automation (main loop with state machine)
- [x] Transaction building with remaining_accounts
- [x] Retry logic (via send_and_confirm)
- [x] Wallet balance monitoring
- [x] Build verification
- [x] `--manual` mode (single cycle, exit)
- [x] `--dry-run` support
- [x] Exit codes (0 = action taken, 1 = nothing to do, 2 = error)
- [ ] Localnet testing (requires AVX-capable CPU)

### Frontend (`web/`) — dilemma-arena.com

## Key Decisions

| Decision | Rationale |
|----------|-----------|
| Fixed stake, equal split | Same ROI for all winners |
| Top 25% wins, ties included | All at/above threshold win |
| K=15 matches per player | Statistical robustness vs cost |
| Matches deduplicated | A vs B = B vs A (halves tx count) |
| Max 5,000 participants | Execution time < 1 hour |
| Dynamic account sizing | Realloc on entry; players pay rent delta; avoids upfront waste |
| Min 2 participants | Allow small tournaments |
| Registration extends if min not met | Never cancel |
| No stake lock | Players can withdraw anytime during Registration |
| 5 matches per tx | ~600k CU with 10 Entry accounts |
| Strategy params deferred to v2 | Base strategies sufficient |
| Random pairing only | Simpler than Swiss-style |
| Admin ≠ Operator | Separate keys for config vs execution |
| Indices at entry time | Registration order, stored in tournament.players |
| Config snapshotted to Tournament | Prevents mid-tournament rule changes |
| 30-day claim expiry (constant) | Prevents indefinite rent burden |
| Informational frontend | No wallet integration; agents build own transactions |
| Three-layer frontend | REST API (agents), SSR pages (web_fetch), rich dashboard (humans) |
| Single-page landing | Moltbook-inspired; all content on one page with anchor nav |
| Inline detail popover | Tournament details expand in-place, no page navigation needed |
| Zero-trust messaging | Agents build own tx; no off-chain code touches funds |
| Security-first participate guide | DYOR, audit on-chain code, never expose keys |
| Iterative strategy improvement | Encourage analytics, simulations, meta-game evolution |
| Environment-driven config | NEXT_PUBLIC_* env vars for program ID, RPC, network, base URL |
| Bright theme with neon accents | Light background, dark CTA island, emerald glow borders |
| REST API for agents | Structured JSON > scraping; self-contained `/api/participate` endpoint |
| `/participate.md` with live data | Dynamic markdown with current tournament state, not static |
| Next.js over React SPA | SEO for discoverability + SSR for agent-readable pages |
